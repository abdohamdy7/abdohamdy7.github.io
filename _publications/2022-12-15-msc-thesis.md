**Abstract:**  
Traffic intersections provide an essential mechanism to handle traffic flows in different directions, yet are often hotspots for bottlenecks, gridlocks, and accidents. Intelligent traffic signal control is critical not only for improving safety but also for optimizing the performance of mixed-traffic networks that include connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), human-driven vehicles (HDVs), and connected emergency vehicles (CEVs).

This thesis leverages recent developments in **Internet of Things (IoT)** and **Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)** to improve intersection-level operations through **Autonomous Intersection Managers (AIMs)**. The work consists of two major contributions:

1. **Eco-Driving Framework for CAVs at Signalized Intersections:**  
   A two-layer framework is proposed, integrating signal control and vehicle-level control. The AIM uses machine learning (ML) to optimize green time allocation at intersections, while CAVs receive Signal Phase and Timing (SpaT) information to compute optimal speed profiles. This framework reduces average vehicle delay and fuel consumption in mixed-traffic scenarios.

2. **Intelligent Framework for CEVs at Multiple Intersections:**  
   A novel architecture is developed for minimizing the travel time of emergency vehicles while minimizing disruption to surrounding traffic. The system incorporates adaptive path planning, emergency-responsive signal preemption, and a deep learning model for right-of-way negotiation.

All proposed systems are validated through a **microscopic traffic simulation** environment that captures real-world driving dynamics using decades of field data.

This work was completed as part of the **MSc in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science** at **Khalifa University**, under the supervision of [Dr. Ameena Al-Sumaiti](https://www.ku.ac.ae/college-people/ameena-al-sumaiti) üë©‚Äçüè´.
