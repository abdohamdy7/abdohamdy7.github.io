This paper investigates the utilization of a hybrid control approach for modeling and analyzing distributed control of a quadruple-tank as a lab-scale benchmark process. The system is implemented via a software-defined architecture for Industrial Internet of Things (I2oT) using low-cost commercial IoT-enabled Intel Galileo Boards.

The proposed I2oT software architecture utilizes **Node.js** and **JavaScript** across multiple system layers, leveraging web sockets for real-time control packet handling. The paper explores how this event-driven software stack enhances the reliability and scalability of industrial automation systems in the context of emerging I2oT frameworks.
