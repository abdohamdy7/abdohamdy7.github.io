This paper addresses the challenge of risk-bounded motion planning for autonomous driving in dynamic environments. Ensuring continuous, real-time decision-making in nonconvex settings is difficult due to static and dynamic obstacles, traffic constraints, and user-specific risk tolerances.

We propose a **graph-based local planning method** using a lattice graph that respects vehicle curvature constraints. Trajectory planning is formulated as an integer linear program with a custom **risk-bounded and prediction-aware shortest path** algorithm.

At the core of our system is a **spatiotemporal risk assessment module** that conservatively evaluates collision risk with both static and moving objects. The planner successfully operates in urban driving scenarios while honoring safety margins and driving preferences.
