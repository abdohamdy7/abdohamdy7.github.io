**Abstract:**  
Internet of Things (IoT) is a hot emerging area that has invaded many aspects of real world applications such as: healthcare, smart buildings, transportation, energy, etc. One rising field of IoT is the **Industrial IoT (I2oT)**. I2oT tends to upgrade current industrial technologies for the next level of automation using IoT and is forming the basis for the upcoming industrial revolution.

This project applies an I2oT environment to a **lab-scale industrial process** that can be remotely monitored and controlled. The **quadruple tank problem (QTP)** was selected as the benchmark process due to its popularity in academia for illustrating concepts in multivariable control systems.

The workflow includes **modeling, control design, simulation, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation**, and deployment. The I2oT platform uses a high-level server with an interactive website for supervisory control over a wireless LAN, and a low-level layer of **IoT-enabled embedded hardware** with decentralized **PI controllers** tuned using a **genetic algorithm**. Controllers were first simulated in Simulink with a nonlinear QTP model, then deployed for real-time experiments. Results confirmed that the system achieved target performance within acceptable time-domain specifications.
